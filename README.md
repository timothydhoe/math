# Fun Math Programmes
*A collection of small, educational Python scripts that explore interesting mathematical concepts through code*

**note: all code is still subject to change.**

## Project Overview

This repo includes short programmes such as:

- Generate Multiplication tables
- Gregory–Leibniz π Approximation
- ...
- Greatest Common Dividor (GCD)

**more to come obviously**


## Getting Started
