# Fun Math Programmes
*A collection of small, educational Python scripts that explore interesting mathematical concepts through code*


## Project Overview

This repo includes short programmes such as:

- Gregory–Leibniz π Approximation
- ...
- Fibonacci Generator — explore recursion and sequence growth.

**more to come obviously**


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
